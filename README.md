#Cloud-native toolchain for microservices

Get started with this sample, which is an online insurance application that consists of three microservices:
- a Catalog API
- an Orders API
- a user interface (UI) that calls both of the APIs.

The sample includes a DevOps toolchain that is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, blue-green deployment, functional testing, issue tracking, online editing, deployment risk analytics and messaging.
