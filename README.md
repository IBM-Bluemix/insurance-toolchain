#Cloud-native toolchain for microservices

Get started with this sample, which is an online insurance application that consists of three microservices:
- an insurance catalog (exposed through an API)
- an order broker microservice (also exposed through an API)
- a user interface (UI) that calls both of the APIs above

The toolchain is preconfigured for:
- issue tracking
- source control
- an online IDE
- continuous delivery and integration (CI/CD)
- functional testing
- notifications and messaging
- deployment risk analytics
- blue-green deployment
